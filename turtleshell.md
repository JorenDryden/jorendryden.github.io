	# Role: Project Lead

	TurtleShell is a locally hosted encryption manager designed to securely store documents, passwords, and other sensitive data. The project focused on implementing industry 	standard cryptographic practices while maintaining a clean, intuitive, and visually polished user interface.

	The application was developed primarily in Java, leveraging Java’s cryptography libraries for secure data handling and JavaFX for the graphical user interface. Emphasis 	was placed on balancing strong security guarantees with usability, ensuring the tool is both robust and accessible to non technical users.
